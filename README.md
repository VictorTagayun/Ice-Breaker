# Ice Breaker
Cozmo asks personal, ice breaking questions to one random person in a group, to help these people get familiar with each other.

## Steps
1. People sit around a table. Put Cozmo at the center.
2. Place one cube in front of Cozmo then start script. This cube will serve as the "next question" button.
3. Cozmo spins for a while, and asks question to the person whose face is first seen by Cozmo.
4. If the person cannot understand the question, place a different cube in front of Cozmo and tap. Cozmo will repeat the question.
5. The group of people chat about this question and the selected person's answer.
6. Place the first cube ("next question" button) in front of Cozmo and tap it. Cozmo will start another round, starting from step 3.
